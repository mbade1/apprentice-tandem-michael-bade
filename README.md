// Goal
// Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select from.
// Use creative license in terms of how you want us to see this game. At minimum, the player can view the question(s), the answer choices, 
// the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command-line-tool, etc. 
// Feel free to use whatever framework or language you are comfortable with.
// We would also like to see a README which includes any information about how to run the code, 
// any known issues or complexity we should look out for, and any additional features you would like to have added to make your 
// trivia app even more awesome.
// Before you begin, familiarity with the following concepts will be helpful:

// Arrays and loops 
// Data manipulation 
// Parsing JSON

//Assumptions:
// A round of trivia has 10 Questions X
// All questions are multiple-choice questions X
// Your score does not need to update in real time X 
// Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose X
// We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file X

//Acceptance Criteria
// A user can view questions. X
// Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time. Questions should not repeat in a round. X (only one question is shown at a time and no repeats)
// A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers. X (once selected, next question is rendered)
// The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer X
// A user can see the score they received at the end of the round X


TOMORROW: MAKE TESTS
// Additional Considerations
// Tandem's first core value is "Ship Quality Work." 
// We love unit tests and automated test coverage in our projects. Well-tested code provides 
// documentation for other developers and prevents future regressions (bugs introduced after a 
// change) among other things. If you would like a challenge, consider adding unit tests to display your commitment to quality code.
